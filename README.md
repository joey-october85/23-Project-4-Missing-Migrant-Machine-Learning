# Project 04 - Global Missing Migrants Dataset
Joey Rodriguez | Ryan Hawkins | Devin Alvarez | Venessa Salazar 

Our team explored a Kaggle dataset which represented migrants who have gone missing on their routes to international destinations from 2014 to 2023. In this project, we extracted, cleaned, and created visual representations for the various migrant demographics (male, female, child), survivability, hazardous routes etc) shown in the dataset. Addiionally, we used machine learning to predict whether the cause of death would be related to natural causes or associated with other factors such as violence.

We utilized python, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, and Tableau which was used to extend visualization presentation.

With this project we accomplished the following:
-	Use a machine learning model to predict cause of death based on multiple features included in the dataset.
-	Produce a confusion matrix that predicts survivors vs deaths
-	Correlation of Survival/Death vs time of year
-	Percentages of dead, missing, and unknown
-	Most hazardous routes
