# Project 04 - Global Missing Migrants Dataset
Joey Rodriguez | Ryan Hawkins | Devin Alvarez | Venessa Salazar | Michaela Dobbs<br><br>

Our team will be exploring data of migrants that have gone missing on their routes to international destinations from 2014 to 2023. In this project we expect to extract and visualize data for migrant demographic (male, female, child), survivability, hazardous routes etc. We will also attempt to use machine learning to predict cause of death.<br>

We will be utilizing python, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, and tensorflow. Additionally, Tableau may be used to extend visualization presentation.<br><br>

With this project we hope to accomplish the following:
-	Use a machine learning model to predict cause of death based on multiple features included in the dataset.
-	Produce a confusion matrix that predicts survivors vs deaths
-	Correlation of Survival/Death vs time of year
-	Percentages of dead, missing, and unknown
-	Most hazardous routes
